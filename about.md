Hey there!

### More Information

I'm Nick Anderson and I'm a security engineer at Facebook. I used to be one of 
the maintainers for the osquery project and enjoy reversing Windows malware when 
I'm not programming. When I'm not wasting away on computers I've been known to 
bake bread and brew beer on occasion.
